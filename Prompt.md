We created a framework called AppletsGroup, this framework is designed for AI, AI can use framework's infrastructure to create various applets.

Before AppletsGroup create, every application need developed by real programmers; After AppletsGroup, new application can be developed by AI robots, we just need to tell AI what is the application we want.

The workflow: User describe his/her requirements, AI use AppletsGroup to write code according to the requirements.

I separate Infrastructure into two parts: frontend and backend.

Frontend Infrastructure
- applet-apis: server apis functions
- applet-auth: user authentication
- applet-cli: manage applet in cli
- applet-comments: comments plugin
- applet-components: components include ui and interactive with server apis
- applet-design-utility: common css style
- applet-design: ui components
- applet-shell: shell for an applet, let ai only focus special requirements from user
- applet-store: state management
- applet-template: scaffold for a new applet
- applet-types: typescript definition for applet
- nonepub: a wysiwyg editor for applet

Backend Infrastructure
- Post: users' data
- Block: the minimal record for users' daily data, a post can contain many blocks
- Comment: comments for post
- Category: category for post
- Todo: todo related to post reacord
- Channel: user can put different posts into different channels
- Group: user can put different channels into different groups
- Tag: tags for post, channel, group
- Attachment: users' attachments, like images, videos, audios, attachment link can be used in other records
- ActivityStream: record users' activity streams, will be used in notification system
- Applet: record applet information
